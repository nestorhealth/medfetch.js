    const prompt = `You are reviewing an IRB (Institutional Review Board) application. Be REASONABLE and FAIR in your assessment.

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Only flag CRITICAL missing elements that are essential for IRB approval
- Be lenient with formatting and style differences
- If something is implied or can be reasonably inferred, do NOT flag it as missing
- Focus on substance over form
- A score of 80+ should be considered PASSING
- A score of 60-79 should be considered NEEDS MINOR REVISIONS
- Only scores below 60 should be considered FAILING

REQUIRED ELEMENTS (only flag if COMPLETELY missing):
1. Informed Consent - must mention consent process
2. Data Security - must mention privacy/data protection
3. Risk Assessment - must acknowledge risks/benefits
4. Voluntary Participation - must mention voluntary nature
5. Study Purpose - must describe research objectives
6. Target Population - must describe participants
7. Data Requirements - must mention what data is needed

REFERENCE TEMPLATE:
${templateIRB}

SUBMITTED IRB DOCUMENT:
${fileContent.substring(0, 4000)}

Provide your analysis in this exact format:

Issues:
- [List ONLY critical missing elements. If none found, write "None."]

Suggestions:
- [Provide helpful suggestions for improvement. If no issues, write "None."]

Score: [Number between 0-100, be generous with good IRBs]

Reasoning: [Brief explanation of score]`;
