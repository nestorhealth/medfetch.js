# SQLite on FHIR
This guide teaches you
- How Medfetch.js hooks into SQLite to provide a FHIR interface
- How to use Medfetch.js SQLite API

Along the way, there will be interactive bits where you can execute SQL directly on your browser 
with the SQLite Web Assembly build to see it firsthand!

## Medfetch.js as a Table Valued Function
Medfetch.js hooks into the SQLite database logic via the [Virtual Table API](https://www.sqlite.org/vtab.html).
For browsers, Medfetch.js is an ES6 module that interfaces with the WebAssembly Virtual Table API,
while on native builds, Medfetch.js is a dynamically linked library that interfaces with the core SQLite C API.

Medfetch.js is registered under SQLite as a `table valued function`, or TVF for short, meaning it can be called as 
if it were to return a table, because that's exactly what it does.

The underlying vtab declaration call that Medfetch.js makes to the sqlite3 API:

```sql
CREATE TABLE resource(
    id TEXT,
    json TEXT,
    type HIDDEN,
    fp   HIDDEN
);
```

`id` is the id field of the resource, while `json` acts as the blob container column that
holds the FHIR data. The `HIDDEN` columns are not directly exposed in the underlying result set
and are instead used as arguments to the `medfetch` table valued function. The only required argument
is arg0 `type`.

### `type` argument
The `type` column acts as arg0 for the TVF that simply indicates which Resource you want to pull.

For example, if you wanted to get all [Practitioners](https://build.fhir.org/practitioner.html) 
from your FHIR server, you would do it like so (minus the LIMIT for all of course):

<SQLCodeblock>

```sql
SELECT * FROM medfetch('Practitioner') LIMIT 5;
```

</SQLCodeblock>

Admittedly, these default values are rather unreadable, so let's clean up the data using
[SQLite JSON functions](https://sqlite.org/json1.html). Suppose we want to read off the names
of each Practitioner registered under the FHIR server, along with when their record was last updated.
Then the JSON extracts might look something like:

<SQLCodeblock columns={["id", "last_updated", "name"]}>

```sql
SELECT
    id,
    json -> 'meta' ->> 'lastUpdated' AS last_updated,
    (json -> 'name' -> 0 -> 'given' ->> 0) 
        || ' '
            || (json -> 'name' -> 0 ->> 'family') AS name
FROM medfetch('Practitioner') LIMIT 5;
```

</SQLCodeblock>

While somewhat verbose, we were able to successfully:

1. Load the FHIR data into SQLite
2. Extract and compute column values from the JSON paths

And we were able to do all this within the same database process!
Let's now turn our attention over to the final TVF argument, the hidden `fp` column.

### `fp` argument
The `fp` column stands for fhirpath, and is completely optional to use. It is primarily there
to act as an escape-hatch for writing JSON transformations with FHIRPath rather than
SQLite's JSON when its JSON functions feel awkward to use or simply doesn't cut it
for a given JSON transformation.

For example, what if we wanted to extract the address into a singular text column?
With SQLite JSON only, we could do something like this:

<SQLCodeblock columns={["id", "last_updated", "name", "address"]}>
```sql
SELECT
    id,
    json -> 'meta' ->> 'lastUpdated' AS last_updated,
    (json -> 'name' -> 0 -> 'given' ->> 0) 
    || ' '
    || (json -> 'name' -> 0 ->> 'family') AS name,

    -- JSON extracts to get address into 1 column
    (json -> 'address' -> 0 -> 'line' ->> 0)
    || ' '
    || (json -> 'address' -> 0 ->> 'city') 
    || ' '
    || (json -> 'address' -> 0 ->> 'state') 
    || ' '
    || (json -> 'address' -> 0 ->> 'postalCode') AS address
    
FROM medfetch('Practitioner') LIMIT 5;
```
</SQLCodeblock>

Alternatively, we can use the `fp` arg1 argument to specify our JSON transformations
**within** the `json` column of our result rows, and then use our `SELECT` block to extract each value. 
This argument must be a `json_array` function call. The elements can either be plaintext pathstrings with *zero* whitespace,
or it can be a 2-tuple* where tuple[0] is the name of the remapped property and tuple[1] is the fhirpath expression
which can be an arbitrary string. 

> *A 3-tuple version is in the works to support the [`forEach`](https://build.fhir.org/ig/FHIR/sql-on-fhir-v2/StructureDefinition-ViewDefinition-definitions.html#ViewDefinition.select.forEach) and [`forEachOrNull`](https://build.fhir.org/ig/FHIR/sql-on-fhir-v2/StructureDefinition-ViewDefinition-definitions.html#ViewDefinition.select.forEachOrNull) operations,
along with the [`unionAll`](https://build.fhir.org/ig/FHIR/sql-on-fhir-v2/StructureDefinition-ViewDefinition-definitions.html#ViewDefinition.select.forEach) directive.

<SQLCodeblock columns={["id", "last_updated", "name", "address"]}>
```sql
SELECT
    id,
    json -> 'lastUpdated' ->> 0 AS last_updated,
    json -> 'full_name' ->> 0 AS name,
    json -> 'address_flat' ->> 0 AS address
FROM 
medfetch('Practitioner', json_array(
    'meta.lastUpdated',
    json_array(
        'full_name',
        '(name[0].given.first() | name[0].family).join('' '')'
    ),
    json_array(
        'address_flat',
        '(address[0].line.first() 
        | address[0].city 
        | address[0].state 
        | address[0].postalCode).join('' '')'
    )
))
LIMIT 5;
```
</SQLCodeblock>

When passed in the `fp` arg1, the Medfetch.js virtual table implementation 
generates a ViewDefinition that looks something like this,
which it then passes off to the [`flat()`]() function with the data to perform the transformations:

```json
{
  "resource": "Practitioner",
  "select": [
    {
      "column": [
        {
          "name": "lastUpdated",
          "path": "meta.lastUpdated",
          "collection": true
        },
        {
          "name": "full_name",
          "path": "(name[0].given.first() | name[0].family).join(' ')",
          "collection": true
        },
        {
          "name": "address_flat",
          "path": "(address[0].line.first() | address[0].city | address[0].state | address[0].postalCode).join(' ')",
          "collection": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Both examples achieve the same result, and I suspect the SQL extracts may be more readable to many. 
And for the most part, you can achieve the same JSON extractions on pure SQLite that you could using pure
ViewDefinitions (in-memory), so `fp` truly is an optional argument.

Still the `fp` argument is there if you need that escape hatch into "FHIRPath" land.

> Please keep in mind that Medfetch.js is still in early alpha, so the APIs written here are subject to change,
particularly the `fp` API, though we suspect this will be the groundwork for streamlining JSON transformations
within SQLite (and SQL databases in general).

<Callout type="info"> 
Good to know: ***EVERY*** FHIRPath expression results in a 1 dimensional array, even for singleton paths.
Since incorporating [FHIR StructureDefinitions](https://build.fhir.org/structuredefinition-definitions.html)
has yet to be implemented, we are limited to *overguessing* that the output will be an array at runtime for the time being.

## Summary
Like the other database runners, Medfetch.js on SQLite adheres as closely as possible to the [in-memory](/quick-start/javascript)
runner signature, so that you only need to learn 1 API and can swap the underlying sql-on-fhir runner.

In Typescript pseudocode, the `medfetch` SQLite TVF can be summed up as having the following signature:

```ts
export function medfetch(
  type: ResourceType,
  fp?: (string | [string, string] | [string, string, string])[] 
): SQLiteTable<{ id: string; json: string; }>;
```

SQLite has a special place in my heart since it was the first database I experimented an in-database runner on
due to the sheer ease of spinning one up (as compared to something like PostgreSQL). While SQLite isn't the most
featureful or "powerful" SQL database by any means (that title goes to PostgreSQL vs. MySQL), you may be surprised
at just how good SQLite can be, so my personal recommendation is to use SQLite if you're just getting started and
then consider upgrading if you find that you're working with millions of rows!
