# Introduction

Welcome to the medfetch.js docs!

## What is it?

Medfetch.js is [Nestor Health](#)'s implementation of
the [sql on fhir](https://build.fhir.org/ig/FHIR/sql-on-fhir-v2/)
specifications that directs FHIR JSON data into SQL tables. It does so
by extending SQLite with a minimal [virtual table module](https://www.sqlite.org/vtab.html).

Built to run completely on modern web browsers, medfetch injects the
[SQLite Web Assembly](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm)
binary with its extension code, meaning the Virtual Table module is
written entirely in JavaScript.

<RunExampleWrapper>
    ```sql SELECT json ->> 'id' AS id, json -> 'given' ->> 0 AS name, json ->>
    'birthDate' AS birthDate FROM medfetch('Patient', json_array( 'id',
    'name.given.first()', 'birthDate' )) LIMIT 5; ```
</RunExampleWrapper>

If you need to send FHIR JSONs into an SQL database at some point in your
ETL pipeline, then Medfetch.js might be the perfect tool for you!

## Motivation

JSONs are great. They let you compact rich data into (relatively) small data payloads
without needing to worry about a schema. So it makes sense to use something like JSONs as the primary data format
for data transfer for [clinical data exchange](https://build.fhir.org/exchange-module.html).
Combine JSON payloads with a tree-based navigation language like [FHIRPath](https://build.fhir.org/fhirpath.html)
and you have an incredibly powerful way to extract and manipulate FHIR JSONs.
