# medfetch.js
Welcome to the medfetch.js docs!

## What is it?
Medfetch.js is [Nestor Health](#)'s *loose*<sup>1</sup> implementation of 
the [sql on fhir](https://build.fhir.org/ig/FHIR/sql-on-fhir-v2/) 
specifications that directs FHIR JSON data into SQL tables. It does so
by extending SQLite with a minimal [virtual table module](https://www.sqlite.org/vtab.html).

Built to run completely on modern web browsers, medfetch injects the
[SQLite Web Assembly](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm)
binary with its extension code, meaning the Virtual Table module is
written entirely in JavaScript<sup>2</sup>.

```sql
SELECT
    json ->> 'id' AS id,
    (json -> 'name' -> 0 -> 'given' ->> 0)
    || ' '
    || (json -> 'name' -> 0 ->> 'family') AS name
FROM medfetch('Patient')
LIMIT 5;
```
