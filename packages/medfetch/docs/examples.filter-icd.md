# Filter by ICD codes

This page demonstrates how to query Resources with ICD code filters. This is
specific to ICD, but the general logic should work with any other code system.

## Within a certain Range
Let's find all Patients under 18 years old admitted after 2015 with tibial shaft fractures.
For ICD, that's any code in the `S82.20`-`S82.299` range.
- SQL:
```sql
CREATE TABLE "patients" AS
SELECT
  "Patient"."id" AS "patient_id",
  "Patient"."name" -> 0 -> 'given' ->> 0 AS "first_name",
  "Patient"."name" -> 0 ->> 'family' AS "last_name",
  "Patient"."birthDate" AS "birth_date",
  "Condition"."code" -> 'coding' -> 0 ->> 'code' AS "icd_code",
  "Condition"."onsetDateTime" AS "condition_onset"
FROM "Patient"
INNER JOIN "Condition" ON "Condition"."subject" = "Patient"."id"
WHERE
  -- Patient is under 18
  date("Patient"."birthDate") > date('now', '-18 years')
  
  -- Condition happened after 2015
  AND date("Condition"."onsetDateTime") > date('2015-01-01')
  
  -- ICD code is in the S82.20â€“S82.299 range
  AND "Condition"."code" -> 'coding' -> 0 ->> 'code' LIKE 'S82.2%';
```
- Javascript:
```ts
const patients = await db
  .selectFrom("Patient")
  .innerJoin("Condition", "Condition.subject", "Patient.id")
  .where(() => sql`date("Patient"."birthDate") > date('now', '-18 years')`)
  .where(() => sql`date("Condition"."onsetDateTime") > date('2015-01-01')`)
  .where(() => sql`"Condition"."code" -> 'coding' -> 0 ->> 'code' LIKE 'S82.2%'`)
```
