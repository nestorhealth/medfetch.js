# Google Sheets Integration
This example shows a potential sql-on-fhir integration with Google Sheets using Medfetch.js.

## Prerequisites
Let's assume you are interested in sending SQL-on-FHIR queries made with Medfetch.js into your
Google Sheets for some data analysis. In this example, we will be performing the analysis on
patients who underwent *any* treatment for acute bronchitis from 2000-2021 inclusive. We are interested
in analyzing the time to abatement for each Procedure type that treats acute bronchitis to get a better idea
of the outcomes.

We will also assume the primary coding system our FHIR server uses is [SNOMED CT](https://www.snomed.org/).

With that out of the way, let's get right into it!

## The Queries
These certainly aren't the only ways to get the same result, so treat these as just
one possibility out of many.

<Callout type="info"> 
Good to know: How you resolve [Reference]() fields depends on how your FHIR server handles writing reference fields down.
For example, the R4 Sandbox Server uses [Relative References](), meaning each foreign-key like property is written as
`<resource-type>/<id>`, which is why in the examples here, we split the reference string by the '/' char and do a equality
check of the `<resource-type>` field, though this is mainly for exiting the equality check early rather than 
correctness since surrogate ids will most likely be unique even across resources, especially if the server uses random UUIDs.
</Callout>

### Conditions
Here is how we can get all [Condition]() resources
that have an entry in their `code` property that equals the SNOMED code for
acute bronchitis (10509002).

### Procedures
Then we'll get all [Procedure]() rows that reference any of our `ab_conditions` rows as 
their `reasonReference`, and then `INNER JOIN` them so we can squash the relevant data into a single nice compact table.

## Exporting to Google Sheets
Congratulations ðŸ¥³, we now have a dataset that's ready for analysis!
Let's wrap up by exporting our `ab_dataset` table to a [Google Sheet]().

The specifics of the export depend on what kind of View Runner you are using,
along with the glue-code you write to export the rows. For the purposes of the
interactive demo, we'll export directly from the memory of the demo WASM databases. 
The overall process should be quite similar no matter which View Runner you are using!

### JS Glue Code
There isn't a direct SQL to Excel-like export mechanism, so we'll have to write
a few lines of "glue code" ourselves. Since these docs are built on top of [NextJS](),
we'll write out the boilerplate for exporting the results via a button press on a React based project,
though the overall logic should be the same no matter what framework you are using.

Follow the [OAuth2]() protocol for your runtime. If you're not serving Medfetch.js to
3rd party users, then you don't need to set up redirects like we do here and can just write
to the Sheets API immediately with your client secret.

### All together
Once we have our Google OAuth setup, we can now write our `ab_dataset` as a plain Google Sheet.
Below is our demo `<ExportDatasetToSheets />{:jsx}` component. Click on it to see all the pieces
come together! If successful, the alert should redirect you to the newly created Sheet.
