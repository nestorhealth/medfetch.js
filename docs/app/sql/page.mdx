# SQL Interface
In this page, you will learn
- How Medfetch.js connects [FHIR servers]() to SQL databases
- How Medfetch.js pulls [FHIR resources]() into your database

## Connection
The primary way FHIR resources are served is via [REST](). At a high level,
this means connecting external FHIR data to a database boils down to
making HTTP network calls inside the database engine, meaning Medfetch.js
really just bakes that functionality into the database.

What you really need to know is that each injected HTTP client concerns itself with exactly **one** FHIR server, 
which Medfetch.js connects to via its [Base URL](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-exchange-routing-ig/specification.html#fhir-service-base-urls).

```ts filename="sqlite-wasm/vtab.ts"
/* In the source code, this is actually an object property named xConnect */
const xConnect = (pDb, _pAux, _argc, _argv, ppVtab, _pzErr) => {
    let rc = capi.SQLITE_OK;
    rc += capi.sqlite3_declare_vtab(
        pDb,
        `CREATE TABLE resource(
            id TEXT,
            json TEXT,
            type HIDDEN,
            fp   HIDDEN
        )`,
    );
    if (!rc) {
        const virtualTable = vtab.xVtab.create(ppVtab) as medfetch_vtab;
        virtualTable.baseURL = aux.baseURL; // One base URL
    }
    return rc;
};
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```cpp filename="sqlite3/medfetch.c"
static int xconnect(sqlite3 *pdb, void *paux, int argc, const char *const *argv,
                    sqlite3_vtab **pp_vtab, char **pz_err) {
    int rc = SQLITE_OK;
    rc += sqlite3_declare_vtab(pdb, "CREATE TABLE resource(id TEXT, json TEXT, type HIDDEN, fp HIDDEN)");
    if (rc == SQLITE_OK) {
        medfetch_vtab *vtab = sqlite3_malloc(sizeof(medfetch_vtab));
        if (vtab == NULL)
            return SQLITE_NOMEM;
        memset(vtab, 0, sizeof(medfetch_vtab));
        vtab->base_url = (const char *) paux; // One base URL
        *pp_vtab = (sqlite3_vtab *) vtab;
    }
    return rc;
}
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Pulling
With a pointer to the base URL stored, the final thing Medfetch.js needs to do to get the 
database runner up is to make the REST API calls with that URL.

### Synchronous `fetch` requests
Both SQLite and PostgreSQL require external data to be presented *synchronously* to their engines.
On native builds of Medfetch.js, this is easier to accomplish since that's 
just a matter of blocking the current database execution thread on the request.
On SQLite native, we do so with [libcurl](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/) (boilerplate code omitted for brevity):

```cpp filename="sqlite3/medfetch.c"
static int curl_fn(fhir_intr_t *intr) {
    CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
    // this is blocking!
    CURLcode res = curl_easy_perform(curl);
    int rc = 0;
    return rc;
}
```

This is made somewhat difficult on Web Assembly builds due to the Web [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch)
API being non-blocking inherently. While Medfetch.js could have used the older, **synchronous** [XHR](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest)
API, it instead opts to invoke `fetch` on a separate Worker thread and simulate blocking on the database thread with the
[Atomics.wait](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Atomics/wait) API.

Here are the relevant code snippets divided up by the code the database thread will run 
and the code the thread running fetch would run (full source code can be found [here](https://github.com/nestorhealth/medfetch.js/blob/main/medfetch/src/fetch.ts)):
<Tabs items={["Database Thread", "Fetch Thread"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```ts filename="fetch.services.ts" /Atomics.wait/
export function FetchSync(port: MessagePort) {
    /* Code omitted for brevity */
    return function fetchSync(...args: Parameters<typeof fetch>) {
        /* ... */
        const message = Fetch.request({ sab, url: args[0], init: args[1], id });
        port.postMessage(message);
        Atomics.wait(signal, 0, 0);
        const statusCode = status[0];
        return new ResponseProxySync(port, sab, id, statusCode);
    }
}
```
</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>
```ts filename="fetch.ts" /Atomics.notify/
const onMessage = (e: MessageEvent<Fetch>): Promise<void> => {
    return Fetch.$match(e.data, {
        request: async ({ sab, url, init, id }) => {
            const signal = new Int32Array(sab, 0, 1);
            const status = new Int32Array(sab, 4, 1);
            const response = await fetch(url, init);
            __RESPONSE_MAP__.set(id, response);
            status[0] = response.status;
            Atomics.store(signal, 0, 1);
            Atomics.notify(signal, 0);
        },
    })
};
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>
With that out the way, we can make the `fetch` function "synchronous", which allows
Medfetch.js to pull FHIR data synchronously for Web Assembly builds of SQLite and PostgreSQL!

So despite running in completely different environments, **the virtual table implementation is nearly identical**, thanks to the blocking `fetchSync()` abstraction in WASM.

<Tabs items={["SQLite3 Web Assembly", "SQLite3 Native"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```ts filename="sqlite-wasm/vtab.ts" /fetchSync/
const xFilter = (pCursor, _idxNum, _idxCStr, argc, argv) => {
    /* ... */
    const cursor = getCursor(pCursor);
    const { baseURL } = getVirtualTable(cursor.pVtab);
    /* ... */

    // Look mom, no await!
    let response = fetchSync(url(baseURL, resourceType), {
        headers: headers()
    });

    /* ... */
    return capi.SQLITE_OK;
};
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```cpp filename="sqlite3/medfetch.c" /search_minpg/
static int xfilter(sqlite3_vtab_cursor *cur, int idxNum, const char *idxStr,
                   int argc, sqlite3_value **argv) {
    /* ... */
    medfetch_cursor *cursor = (medfetch_cursor *) cur;
    medfetch_vtab *vtab = (medfetch_vtab *) cur->pVtab;

    /* ... */
    json_t *result = search_minpg(search, -1, 250);

    /* free() calls omitted */
    return SQLITE_OK;
}
```
</Tabs.Tab>

And as you may have noticed, this request handler isn't responsible for parsing 
the response body, which we'll go over next.

### Streaming
Responses from web APIs often arrive in indeterminate-size chunks, 
meaning your application doesn't receive the entire response body all at once.
Instead, it trickles in as the server streams it. 

Medfetch.js takes full advantage of this by processing the raw body text
as it comes in and hands off parsed resources one-by-one to the database engine.
For large payloads like FHIR Bundles, this approach is usually prefereable to parsing the entire JSON, 
and *then* handing off the resources one-by-one to the database engine.

With native, this just means buffer parsing to detect when we are
given a "row" / resource within the payload, since we can perform the JSON parsing on
the same thread that ran the fetch request (the database thread).

For Web Assembly, we need to do this *and* manually block the database thread
since the FHIR Server Response is ***not*** actually given to that thread
(but rather, the worker thread running the `fetch` calls).

<Tabs items={["Database Thread", "Fetch Thread"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```ts filename="fetch.services.ts" /Atomics.wait/
class ResponseProxySync {
    get stream() {
        const signal = this.#signal();
        const msg = Fetch.startStream({ sab: this.#sab, id: this.#id });
        this.#port.postMessage(msg);
        Atomics.wait(signal, 0, 0);
        const result = Atomics.load(signal, 0);
        /* ... */
        return this.#bodyIt();
    }

    *#bodyIt() {
        while (true) {
            const signal = this.#signal();
            const msg = Fetch.readChunk({ sab: this.#sab, id: this.#id });
            this.#port.postMessage(msg);
            Atomics.wait(signal, 0, 0);
            /* ... */
            const body = new Uint8Array(this.#sab, 8, size);
            const chunk = new TextDecoder().decode(body.slice());
            yield chunk;
        }
    }
}
```

            const signal = new Int32Array(sab, 0, 1);
            /* ... */
            const reader = response.body.getReader();
            __READER_MAP__.set(id, reader);

            Atomics.store(signal, 0, 1);

Going in depth over the SAX parsing logic would be out of the scope of this page.
What you should really take away from this is that Medfetch.js yields resource "rows"
to your database one by one via a Stream abstraction to squeeze out as much performance
as possible!

<Callout type="warning">
As of the time of writing, only the Web Assembly ports have Streaming implemented, since
the original C extension was written early on as a prototype. I will eventually
get to implementing it on C since the JS based SAX parser I used, [clarinet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clarinet),
is based on [yajl](https://github.com/lloyd/yajl), so (hopefully) this port won't be too bad!
</Callout>

### Auth
Since FHIR servers are web APIs, authenticating and authorizing (which we'll group together as *auth*) access to data is implementation dependent.
Luckily, the [SMART on FHIR](https://docs.smarthealthit.org/) protocol a standard for FHIR servers to
manage auth via user-familiar sign-ins with [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/).

Going over the OAuth2 flows goes ***way*** beyond the scope of this page, but generally speaking,
the end-result of any OAuth2 flow is getting an access token (usually a JWT) that you send over
via the Headers in your FHIR API calls.

And since all the database cares about insofar as pulling the FHIR data is that access token,
Medfetch.js abstracts the auth process into providing a callback for retrieving said
access token.

Here's one way we could provide that callback to the SQLite Web Assembly port. Note that
the only helper the core library exposes for browser based builds is the `pkce` function for the
[PKCE OAuth2 flow](https://oauth.net/2/pkce/), although you can of course, get the access token however you want.

```ts
import { pkce } from "medfetch";
import { medfetch } from "medfetch/sqlite-wasm";

const BASE_URL =
  "https://launch.smarthealthit.org/v/r4/sim/WzIsIiIsIiIsIkFVVE8iLDAsMCwwLCIiLCIiLCJ3aGF0ZXZlciIsIiIsIiIsIiIsIiIsMCwyLCIiXQ/fhir";
const CLIENT_ID = "whatever";
const REDIRECT_URI = process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" 
    ? "http://localhost:3000/sql"
    : "https://medfetchjs.pages.dev/sql";
const scope = ["user/*.cruds"];

export const sql = medfetch(BASE_URL, {
  trace: true,
  async getAccessToken() {
    const { getRedirectURL, exchange } = pkce(
      BASE_URL,
      CLIENT_ID,
      REDIRECT_URI,
      scope,
    );
    const params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
    const code = params.get("code");
    let body: Awaited<ReturnType<typeof exchange>>;
    try {
      if (code) {
        body = await exchange(code);
      } else {
        const redirectURL = await getRedirectURL();
        window.location.href = redirectURL;
        throw new Error("This shouldn't happen");
      }
    } finally {
      window.history.replaceState({}, document.title, window.location.pathname);
    }

    if (body)
      return body;
    
    throw new Error("Shouldn't happen");
  },
});
```

Done this way, as long as your access token getter callback returns the expected payload, which is database implementation specific,
then Medfetch.js will handle determining the access token state (is it expired / is it not expired) and calling `getAccessToken()`
when it needs a new token.

You can see how the above example would work right here. Click run to initiate the user-login and then
when redirected back, hit run again to send that token over to the sqlite wasm runner.

<SQLCodeblock mode="auth">
```sql
SELECT * FROM medfetch('Practitioner');
```
</SQLCodeblock>

<Callout type="warning">
As of the time of writing, only the Web Assembly ports have Authorization headers implemented,
but the overall idea of deferring the actual auth handling to the application developer as much as possible
will probably remain.
</Callout>

Specifics regarding auth for each database, along with data streaming, can be found in the corresponding database interface pages.
