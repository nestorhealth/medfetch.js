# Javascript
Pull and flatten FHIR data directly from your own Javascript code with Medfetch.js in-memory runner!

## Installation
[fhirpath](https://hl7.github.io/fhirpath.js/) is a peer dependencies.

<Tabs items={["pnpm", "npm"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```bash copy
pnpm add fhirpath medfetch
```
</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>
```bash copy
npm install effect fhirpath medfetch
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Usage
You will need a FHIR base URL. If you just want to test Medfetch out on some
live dummy data, I recommend using a public sandbox like the smarthealth-it r4 server.
More can be found on the [Confluence](https://confluence.hl7.org/spaces/FHIR/pages/35718859/Public+Test+Servers) sandbox listings page.

Once you have your base url, you can instantiate the `sof` (sql-on-fhir shorthand) client:

```ts
// sof.ts
import { medfetch } from "medfetch";

// Your base URL as arg0
export const sof = medfetch("https://r4.smarthealthit.org/");
```

This `sof` client is a function with the following signature:

```ts
export type SOF = <
    ResourceType extends string,
    Keys extends readonly string[]
>(
    resourceType: ResourceType,
    keys: readonly [...Keys],
) => Promise<Flattened<Keys>[]>;
```

So you might call it like so:

```ts
import { sof } from "./sof";

const patientsClean: {
    id: unknown;
    name: unknown;
    birthDate: unknown;
}[] = await sof("Patient", [
    "id",
    "name",
    "birthDate"
]);
```

Under the hood, this function acts as a wrapper over ViewDefinition creation and
executes the generated ViewDefinition against our sql-on-fhir memory flattener.

## View Definitions
If you're interested in writing up your own View Definitions, you can do so with Medfetch, although this 
isn't intended to be the primary API because of its boiler-platy nature.

You can either write up the ViewDefinitions as plain objects / JSON yourself, or use the
`viewDefinition` helper function that provides "type safety" over your view definitions.
In either case, you pass your View Definition to the `flat` function:

```ts
import { 
    ViewDefinition,
    Column,
    ColumnPath,
    flat
} from "medfetch";
import { getPatients } from "./my-data-fetchers";

const patientView = ViewDefinition({
    status: "active",
    resource: "Patient",
    select: [
        Column({
            column: [
                ColumnPath({
                    name: "id",
                    path: "id"
                })
            ]
        })
    ],
    where: [
        {
            path: "name.family.exists() and name.family = 'foo'"
        }
    ]
});

const jsonData = await getPatients();
const flattened = flat(jsonData, patientView);
```
