# sqlite-wasm
Spin up a sql-on-fhir View Runner on the browser with Medfetch.js and [sqlite-wasm](https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite-wasm)

## Installation
[fhirpath](https://hl7.github.io/fhirpath.js/), and [@sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm) are peer dependencies.

<Tabs items={["pnpm", "npm"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```bash copy
pnpm add medfetch fhirpath @sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm
```
</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>
```bash copy
npm install effect fhirpath @sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm medfetch
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

You will need to add [tsup](https://tsup.egoist.dev/) as a dev dependency in order to bundle the worker script:
<Tabs items={["pnpm", "npm"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```bash copy
pnpm add -D tsup
```
</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>
```bash copy
npm install --save-dev tsup
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

Then compile/transpile the virtual table extension into your `/public` folder as `/public/sqlite-ext/medfetch.mjs`.

```bash
npx medfetch bundle
```

## Usage
If using as a new database:

```ts
// sof.ts
import { medfetch } from "medfetch/sqlite-wasm";

// Can name this whatever of course
export const sql = medfetch("https://your-fhir-server.here");

// Or if you want to open a file in the OPFS VFS with medfetch attached to the database
const sql2 = medfetch("...", {
  filename: "my-db"
});
```

Currently, if you want to mutate a SQLite database before
attaching Medfetch onto it, you must use the [`worker1`]()
from the package (this is to load the Virtual Table).

```ts
import { medfetch, worker1 } from "medfetch/sqlite-wasm";

// Create a worker1 thread, or get an existing one
const w1 = worker1();
const { dbId } = await w1("open", {
    vfs: "opfs",
    filename: "my-db"
});

// Can name this whatever of course
export const sql = medfetch("https://your-fhir-server.here", { dbId });
```

`sql` here is a lazily executed template strings function. It's
an [Effect](https://effect.website/docs/getting-started/the-effect-type/) from [effect](https://effect.website) wrapped with a `then` method to make it awaitable.
So queries can be executed independently of effect simply by awaiting it.

```ts
// This is an effect with a .then attached to be awaitable
const getPatients = async () => await sql<{
  id: string;
  name: HumanName[];
}>`create table patients as 
   select json ->> 'id' as id,
   select json -> 'name' as name
   from medfetch('Patient');`;
```

So when a user does some action, say from React code, you can wrap the query like you would with any stateful async query.

```ts
import { getPatients } from "./queries.js";
import { useMutation } from "@tanstack/react-query";

export function GetPatientsButton() {
  const { mutate, isPending, data } = useMutation({
    mutationFn: getPatients
  });
  return <Button onClick={() => mutate()}></Button>;
}
```
